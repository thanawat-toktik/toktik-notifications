# Toktik Notifications

Notification system that is basically the websocket backend because Django hates us.

## Set up
Do your usual `npm install`


## Run this thing

```nodemon ./src/index.js```
nodemon is a library that allows for reload on file change so you don't have to kill and rerun
Note: I also have added a script in `package.json` so that you can also do `npm run start`
